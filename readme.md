# WeRateDogs

This is my project on Data Wrangling for the Udacity's Data Analysis Nano Degree Program. It's an analyisis of nearly 3000 tweets from the WeRateDogs user account. 

The project is divided in two sections: 

- Data Acquisition and Cleaning: 
There are three separate data sources: the provided twitter-archive-enhanced-2.csv and image-predictions-2.tsv and a json file than can be dowloaded using the Twitter API (outlined in the notebook). 
Each source is analyzed, cleaned and transformed necessary to prepare for the next phase. The relevant features are merged and exported into a final dataframe. 

- Data Analysis: 
Using the exported dataframe, the analysis seeks to answer if the dog ratings follow any particular patter or are mostly random and fun.
